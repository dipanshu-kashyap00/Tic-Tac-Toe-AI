# 🤖 Tic-Tac-Toe AI (C Language)

A classic **Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent** built using the **C programming language**.  
This project allows a user to play against a computer that makes intelligent moves using basic AI logic.

It demonstrates important programming concepts such as:
- Arrays
- Game loops
- Conditional statements
- Functions
- Win-condition checking
- Basic AI decision making

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🎮 Play Tic-Tac-Toe in the terminal
- 🧠 Computer opponent with AI-based moves
- 🔁 Turn-based gameplay (Player vs AI)
- 🟦 3×3 game board display
- 🏆 Automatic win/draw detection

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: C
- Compiler: GCC
- Terminal / Console-based execution

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/dipanshu-kashyap00/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI.git

2. Move to the project directory:

   cd Tic-Tac-Toe-AI

3. Compile the program:

   gcc TicTacToe.c -o TicTacToe

4. Run the program:

   ./TicTacToe

## 📌 How the Game Works

- The game starts with an empty 3×3 board.
- The player and AI take alternate turns.
- The player selects a position on the board.
- The AI automatically chooses its move.
- The game checks for:
  - Win (3 marks in a row)
  - Draw (board full with no winner)

The AI follows simple strategic logic to:
- Try to win if possible
- Block the player from winning
- Choose the best available position

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The game runs completely in the terminal.
- No external libraries are required.
- Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS with a C compiler.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project helps in understanding:

- Board representation using arrays
- Turn-based game logic
- AI move selection strategy
- Win-condition validation
- Clean structured programming in C
